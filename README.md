# gemini-agent-tooling

This project aims to improve Gemini API integration across popular open-source agent and workflow frameworks such as **LangChain**, **LlamaIndex**, **CrewAI**, and **Composio**. By expanding multimodal support, improving function-calling capabilities, and providing high-quality examples and documentation, this project will empower developers to build more intelligent, robust, and versatile AI agent applications with Gemini models.
